"Battling Data with GraphQL & React" Dev Academy Course

```
DAY-01 - Danny Ou
---
What did I learn today?
- GraphQL requests are dynamic; users can put in any acceptable attributes in ONE request.
- GraphQL and caching can help with state management in React. All React Components can now be Stateless components using GraphQL calls to change state; no need for Redux.

What am I going to add to the app?
- I am going to add more descriptions to the Pokemon

What do I feel stuck on?
- How are resolvers generated?
- What is the backend like for GraphQL?
- How to mutate state?
- How does authentication work in GraphQL? For example, what if (1) attribute can be exposed to some users and not all?
```
