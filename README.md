"Battling Data with GraphQL & React" Dev Academy Course

## DAY-01 - Danny Ou

What did I learn today?

- GraphQL requests are flexible; users can put in any acceptable attributes in ONE request.
- GraphQL and caching can help with state management in React. All React Components can now be Stateless components using GraphQL calls to change state; no need for Redux.

What am I going to add to the app?

- I am going to add more descriptions to the Pokemon

What do I feel stuck on?

- How are resolvers generated?
- What is the backend like for GraphQL?
- How to mutate state?
- How does authentication work in GraphQL? For example, what if (1) attribute can be exposed to some users and not all?

## DAY-02 - Danny Ou

What did I learn today?

- Apollo Client has an amazing memory caching library that allows for offline use of apps
- Render prop design is used more over HOC design pattern
- queries and mutations can use the gql library to create custom query functions

What am I going to add to the app?

- I'll be adding `weaknesses` and `classification` to the Pokemon Card

What do I feel stuck on?

- How are resolvers created?
- How do subscriptions work?
- How does the Apollo caching work?

## DAY-04 - Danny Ou

- PTO

What am I going to add to the app?

- I'll be adding a sidebar to handle adding Pokemon to Team using Apollo Mutation
